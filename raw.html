    <h2>Division 1 — Principles and declarations</h2>
    <h3>87.Principles applying in relation to this Part</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>(1)Section 88 sets out principles that apply for the purposes of the application, operation and interpretation of this Part.</li>
      <li>(2)This section and section 88 do not limit section 3(2).
        <h3>88.Principles listed</h3>
      </li>
      <li>(1)The spread of notifiable infectious diseases should be prevented or limited without unnecessarily restricting personal liberty or privacy, and in the application of this principle particular regard should be had to the principle of proportionality set out in section 3(2).</li>
      <li>(2)A person who is at risk of contracting a notifiable infectious disease must take all reasonable precautions to avoid contracting the disease.</li>
      <li>(3)A person who suspects that he or she may have a notifiable infectious disease must ascertain —</li>
      <li>(a)whether or not he or she has the disease; and</li>
      <li>(b)what precautions should be taken to prevent others from contracting the disease.</li>
      <li>(4)A person who has a notifiable infectious disease must take all reasonable precautions to ensure that others are not unknowingly placed at risk of contracting the disease.</li>
      <li>(5)To the extent to which the exercise of those rights does not infringe on the wellbeing of others, a person who is at risk of contracting, who suspects that he or she may have, or who has a notifiable infectious disease or a notifiable infectious disease‑related condition has these rights —</li>
      <li>(a)to be protected from unlawful discrimination;</li>
      <li>(b)to have his or her privacy respected;</li>
      <li>(c)to be given information about the medical and social consequences of the disease or condition and about any proposed medical treatment;</li>
      <li>(d)in the case of a notifiable infectious disease —</li>
      <li>(i)to have access to available and appropriate examination and treatment; and</li>
      <li>(ii)to have that examination and treatment provided free of charge, but only if the requirements set out in subsection (6) are met.</li>
      <li>(6)The right to have an examination or treatment provided free of charge under subsection (5)(d)(ii) applies —</li>
      <li>(a)only if the examination or treatment is provided by a public health official; and</li>
      <li>(b)only to the extent that the examination or treatment is necessary to prevent the transmission of the disease to another person.
        <h3>89.Further provisions relating to application of principles</h3>
      </li>
      <li>(1)A failure to comply with the principles set out in section 88(2) to (4) does not of itself —</li>
      <li>(a)give rise to any right or remedy; or</li>
      <li>(b)constitute an offence.</li>
      <li>(2)However, a failure to comply with one or more of those principles may constitute grounds for action to be taken under this Act, including the issue of a test order or a public health order.</li>
      <li>(3)Section 88(5) does not confer on any person any legal right that is enforceable in a court of law.</li>

  <li>(5)If any action taken under subsection (3) involves the removal of an item of clothing —</li>

  <li>(4)The magistrate must cause a record to be made (on the warrant or otherwise) of the matters of fact on which the magistrate has relied to justify the issue of the warrant.</li>
  <li>(5)The warrant authorises the person specified in the warrant (and any police officer accompanying that person under section 126(1)(a)) —</li>

  <li>(a)for the period (not exceeding 30 days) specified in the warrant as the period during which it remains in force; or</li>
  <li>(b)if no period is so specified, for 30 days from the date of its issue.</li>
  <li>(3)However, the warrant ceases to be in force when it is executed.
    <h4>127.Review by State Administrative Tribunal</h4>
  </li>
  <li>(1)A person to whom a public health order applies (the applicant) may apply to the State Administrative Tribunal for a review of —</li>

  <li>(b)if the order is varied under section 116(5), the decision to vary the order.</li>
  <li>(2)The State Administrative Tribunal must hear and determine the application as a matter of priority and urgency.</li>
  <li>(3)Without limiting the matters that the State Administrative Tribunal may consider in determining the application, the State Administrative Tribunal must consider —</li>

  <li>(c)the past behaviour and likely behaviour of the applicant; and</li>
  <li>(d)the extent of the restrictions imposed on the applicant.
    <h4>128.Restriction on making of further public health order</h4>
  </li>
  <li>(1)This section applies to a person in respect of whom a public health order is made if the order ceases to have effect —</li>
  <li>(a)as the result of being revoked by a further order made under section 116; or</li>

  <li>(i)the decision of the State Administrative Tribunal on a review under section 127; or</li>
  <li>(ii)an appeal from that decision.</li>
  <li>(2)A further public health order may be made in respect of a person to whom this section applies only if the Chief Health Officer reasonably believes that, since the earlier public health order ceased to have effect, there has been a change in the person’s health or behaviour that increases the risk of the person transmitting a notifiable infectious disease to another person.

  <li>(a)a person is subject to an order under a corresponding law; and</li>

  <li>(b)section 127(1)(a) does not apply.</li>

  <li>(5)If an order operates in this State under subsection (3) —</li>
  <li>(a)the Chief Health Officer may, by written notice served in accordance with section 130(2), vary the order as it operates in this State, but only to the extent reasonably necessary for its effective operation in this State; and</li>
  <li>(b)the order ceases to operate in this State if —</li>
  <li>(i)the order expires or is revoked under the corresponding law; or</li>
  <li>(ii)the Chief Health Officer revokes the order under section 116(5).
    <h4>130.Further provisions applying to interstate public health orders operating in this State</h4>
  </li>
  <li>(1)Section 119 applies, with all necessary changes, to an order to which section 129 applies as if the order were a public health order made under this Division.</li>
  <li>(2)If a notice is given under section 129(5)(a) varying an order to which section 129 applies —</li>
  <li>(a)sections 118 and 119 apply, with all necessary changes, to the notice; and</li>
  <li>(b)the person who is subject to the order may apply to the State Administrative Tribunal under section 127(1)(b) as if the order had been varied under section 116(5).</li>
  <li>(3)The variation, under section 129(5)(a), of an order to which section 129 applies does not prevent the order being varied under section 116(5).</li>
  <li>(4)The fact that an order to which section 129 applies has ceased to operate in this State does not prevent a public health order subsequently being made under this Division in relation to the same person.

    <h4>131.Annual report to include information about test orders and public health orders</h4>
  </li>
  <li>(1)The accountable authority of the Department must include the following information in each annual report submitted under the Financial Management Act 2006 Part 5 —</li>
