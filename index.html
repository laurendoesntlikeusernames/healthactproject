  <p>(c)the extent to which the person who committed the offence could reasonably have foreseen that risk; and</p>
  <p>(d)the extent to which the person who committed the offence had control over the circumstances that gave rise to that risk; and</p>

  <h1>Part 9 - Notifiable infectious diseases and related and conditions</h1>

  <p>Division 1&nbsp;—&nbsp;Principles and declarations</p>
  <p>87.Principles applying in relation to this Part</p>
  <p>(1)Section&nbsp;88 sets out principles that apply for the purposes of the application, operation and interpretation of this Part.</p>
  <p>(2)This section and section&nbsp;88 do not limit section&nbsp;3(2).</p>
  <p>88.Principles listed</p>
  <p>(1)The spread of notifiable infectious diseases should be prevented or limited without unnecessarily restricting personal liberty or privacy, and in the application of this principle particular regard should be had to the principle of proportionality set out in section&nbsp;3(2).</p>
  <p>(2)A person who is at risk of contracting a notifiable infectious disease must take all reasonable precautions to avoid contracting the disease.</p>
  <p>(3)A person who suspects that he or she may have a notifiable infectious disease must ascertain&nbsp;—</p>
  <p>(a)whether or not he or she has the disease; and</p>
  <p>(b)what precautions should be taken to prevent others from contracting the disease.</p>
  <p>(4)A person who has a notifiable infectious disease must take all reasonable precautions to ensure that others are not unknowingly placed at risk of contracting the disease.</p>
  <p>(5)To the extent to which the exercise of those rights does not infringe on the wellbeing of others, a person who is at risk of contracting, who suspects that he or she may have, or who has a notifiable infectious disease or a notifiable infectious disease‑related condition has these rights&nbsp;—</p>
  <p>(a)to be protected from unlawful discrimination;</p>
  <p>(b)to have his or her privacy respected;</p>
  <p>(c)to be given information about the medical and social consequences of the disease or condition and about any proposed medical treatment;</p>
  <p>(d)in the case of a notifiable infectious disease&nbsp;—</p>
  <p>(i)to have access to available and appropriate examination and treatment; and</p>
  <p>(ii)to have that examination and treatment provided free of charge, but only if the requirements set out in subsection&nbsp;(6) are met.</p>
  <p>(6)The right to have an examination or treatment provided free of charge under subsection&nbsp;(5)(d)(ii) applies&nbsp;—</p>
  <p>(a)only if the examination or treatment is provided by a public health official; and</p>
  <p>(b)only to the extent that the examination or treatment is necessary to prevent the transmission of the disease to another person.</p>
  <p>89.Further provisions relating to application of principles</p>
  <p>(1)A failure to comply with the principles set out in section&nbsp;88(2) to&nbsp;(4) does not of itself&nbsp;—</p>
  <p>(a)give rise to any right or remedy; or</p>
  <p>(b)constitute an offence.</p>
  <p>(2)However, a failure to comply with one or more of those principles may constitute grounds for action to be taken under this Act, including the issue of a test order or a public health order.</p>
  <p>(3)Section&nbsp;88(5) does not confer on any person any legal right that is enforceable in a court of law.</p>
  <p>(4)Sections&nbsp;87 and&nbsp;88 do not limit the Equal Opportunity Act&nbsp;1984 section&nbsp;66U.</p>

  <p>(c)a notifiable infectious disease to be a vaccine preventable notifiable infectious disease.</p>

  <p>(b)a vaccine preventable notifiable infectious disease may also be declared to be an urgently notifiable infectious disease.</p>
  <p>(4)If there is any conflict or inconsistency between a declaration by the regulations under subsection&nbsp;(1) and a declaration by the Minister under subsection&nbsp;(2), the Minister’s declaration prevails.</p>

  <p>103.Effect of test orders</p>
  <p>(1)A test order (other than an order that relates to a protected person or a deceased person)&nbsp;—</p>

  <p>(ii)the relevant person is given a reasonable opportunity to remove the thing himself or herself, and refuses or fails to do so.</p>
  <p>(4)Without limiting subsection&nbsp;(3), the force that an authorised officer or police officer may use to enforce a test order includes any force that it is reasonably necessary to use in the circumstances to overcome any resistance to the enforcement of the test order (including the obtaining or taking of the sample that is the subject of the order) that is offered by the relevant person, or that the authorised officer or police officer reasonably suspects will be offered by the relevant person.</p>
  <p>(5)If any action taken under subsection&nbsp;(3) involves the removal of an item of clothing&nbsp;—</p>

  <p>(2)The State Administrative Tribunal must hear and determine the application as a matter of priority and urgency.</p>
  <p>(3)Without limiting the matters that the State Administrative Tribunal may consider in determining the application, the State Administrative Tribunal must consider&nbsp;—</p>

  <p>(d)the extent of the restrictions imposed on the applicant.</p>

  <p>(b)as the result of&nbsp;—</p>
  <p>(i)the decision of the State Administrative Tribunal on a review under section&nbsp;127; or</p>
  <p>(ii)an appeal from that decision.</p>
  <p>(2)A further public health order may be made in respect of a person to whom this section applies only if the Chief Health Officer reasonably believes that, since the earlier public health order ceased to have effect, there has been a change in the person’s health or behaviour that increases the risk of the person transmitting a notifiable infectious disease to another person.</p>
  <p>129.Recognition of interstate public health orders</p>
  <p>(1)In this section&nbsp;—</p>
  <p>corresponding law means a provision of a law of another State, a Territory or the Commonwealth that is prescribed by the regulations to be a corresponding law for the purposes of this section;</p>
  <p>order includes a notice, requirement or direction.</p>
  <p>(2)This section applies if&nbsp;—</p>
  <p>(a)a person is subject to an order under a corresponding law; and</p>
  <p>(b)the terms of the order provide for matters that could be the subject (wholly or substantially) of a public health order under this Division; and</p>
  <p>(c)the person enters this State.</p>
  <p>(3)If this section applies, the order to which the person is subject operates in this State, in accordance with this section, as if it were a public health order made under this Division, but with the following modifications&nbsp;—</p>
  <p>(a)the order has the terms set out in the order or applying to it under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was made, with any variations made under subsection&nbsp;(5)(a) or section&nbsp;116(5);</p>
  <p>(b)section&nbsp;127(1)(a) does not apply.</p>
  <p>(4)An order that operates in this State under subsection&nbsp;(3) has no effect until a copy of the order (with or without any variations made under subsection&nbsp;(5)(a)) is served personally in accordance with section&nbsp;118(1) or&nbsp;(2).</p>
  <p>(5)If an order operates in this State under subsection&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;—</p>
  <p>(a)the Chief Health Officer may, by written notice served in accordance with section&nbsp;130(2), vary the order as it operates in this State, but only to the extent reasonably necessary for its effective operation in this State; and</p>
  <p>(b)the order ceases to operate in this State if&nbsp;—</p>
  <p>(i)the order expires or is revoked under the corresponding law; or</p>
  <p>(ii)the Chief Health Officer revokes the order under section&nbsp;116(5).</p>
  <p>130.Further provisions applying to interstate public health orders operating in this State</p>
  <p>(1)Section&nbsp;119 applies, with all necessary changes, to an order to which section&nbsp;129 applies as if the order were a public health order made under this Division.</p>
  <p>(2)If a notice is given under section&nbsp;129(5)(a) varying an order to which section&nbsp;129 applies&nbsp;—</p>
  <p>(a)sections&nbsp;118 and&nbsp;119 apply, with all necessary changes, to the notice; and</p>
  <p>(b)the person who is subject to the order may apply to the State Administrative Tribunal under section&nbsp;127(1)(b) as if the order had been varied under section&nbsp;116(5).</p>
  <p>(3)The variation, under section&nbsp;129(5)(a), of an order to which section&nbsp;129 applies does not prevent the order being varied under section&nbsp;116(5).</p>
  <p>(4)The fact that an order to which section&nbsp;129 applies has ceased to operate in this State does not prevent a public health order subsequently being made under this Division in relation to the same person.</p>
